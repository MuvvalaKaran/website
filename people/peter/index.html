<p>Hey, Iâ€™m Peter. I am a senior undergraduate studying aerospace engineering at CU Boulder. I am very excited for how far autonomous robots will progress in my lifetime, and I would love to take part in creating that future. I am currently working on modeling a robot manipulator, while giving it the means to complete a simple high level task. In the future, I hope to take part in studying autonomous decision making with safety guarantees based on a regret minimization framework.</p>
